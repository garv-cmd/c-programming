/*
NOTES:-
1.const int *p;   --> p is a pointer to integer constant
2.int const *p;   --> p is a pointer to constant integer
SO, We can perform increment or decrement operattions: p++; or p--;
but we cannot operate (*p)++; or (*p)--; because teh value to p which it is pointing is constant;
3.int *const r;   --> r is const pointer to integer
q++; Cannot operate NO
(*q)++; YES
4.const int *const r;   -->r is const pointer to integer const
r++; NO
(*r)++; NO
